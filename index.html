            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Patryk Plekaniec, I am 17 years old, I live in Poland, where I was born. Polish is my native language but I can use english without any problems.<br>
            I want to be a web developer in future so I am starting now by small steps.</p>
        </div><br><br>
        <div id="personality">
            <h1>My personality</h1>
            <p>To introduce my person, there is a list of my personality traits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am <strong>creative</strong>. I can come up with some ideas.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>easy-going</strong>, at least I am trying to be.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>industrious</strong>. I want to do job as quick as it's possible.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>helpful</strong>. I like to help peaple where I can.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>not bossy</strong>.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>fair</strong> to another people.</li>
                </ul><br>
        </div>
        <div id="skill">
            <h1>My skills</h1>
            <p>As a 17 years old boy, I have some skills. I can <strong>make websites with some design</strong><br>(using HTML, CSS and some JS), so if you are looking for someone who can make a website for you, you can choose me! But keep in mind I am still learning. I have some knowledge in <strong>C++ and python</strong> languages but only very basics. As I said earlier, I can speak in 2 languages, <strong>polish</strong> (native) and <strong>english</strong> (conversational level), so it means I can translate english into polish. Also, I can make some <strong>easy graphics</strong> in Photoshop.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="education">
            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>So, I don't have any extended education, such as degree, but I am autodidact.<br>
            I've passed elementary school (2012-2020), now I am in IT technical school (2020-now). I am learning HTML, CSS and JS for almost a year now.</p>
